## Day 25

Decided to use some iterators here leading to some really ugly code in my opinion!

In a weird way I'm happy that the code works but there are several things I want to change in the future:
- less iterators!
- more efficient part 2, without needing to iterate through every star pair several times to combine all fractured constellations

## Day 22

Had to do my research to learn Dijkstra but it was worth it. Not too crazy moving from BFS to Dijkstra but the time spend writing utility code (points, setting up priority queue, operator overloads) took a little while. Some of this I think I should add to my utilities, as it would speed up future work.
